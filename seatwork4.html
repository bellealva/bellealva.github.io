            Retrogaming, also known as classic gaming and old school gaming, is
            the playing or collecting of older personal computer, console, and
            arcade video games in contemporary times. Usually retrogaming is
            based upon systems that are obsolete or discontinued.

                        <p>We are living in a golden age of gaming, with an
                        incredible range of interactive experiences to suit
                        every taste. Even so, we occasionally pine for the
                        simpler days of the arcade era, and the 8- and 16-bit
                        titles that turned us into the healthy, sleep-shirking
                        addicts we are today.</p>

                        first-person shooter, Duck Hunt didn't allow you to
                        blast zombies, mutants or even mutant zombies. But
                        lowering the waterfowl population was just as
                        satisfying. Perhaps it was the bundled NES Zapper, one
                        of the finest lightguns we've wielded. Or maybe it was
                        the chance to wipe the smirk off of that dog's
                        face.</p>

                        Not least when you figure out how the light and dark
                        worlds slot together. Unlike these days where you're

                        platform game, Nintendo reinvented it with the
                        secret-packed Super Mario Bros. 3, then repeated it
                        with Super Mario World. The two best side-scrollers of
                        all time, it's a heck of a job to separate them. The
                        sprawling ambition of SMB3 or the invention of SMW? The
                        Frog Suit or Yoshi? The Super Leaf or the Cape Feather?
                        We've plumped for SMB3, but they're so close to gaming
                        perfection, there's nothing in it.</p>
